## Blog (Laravel 11)

## Description
A simple blog application built with Laravel 11.

## Features
- User registration and login
- Admin can manage posts and categories
- Users can:
  - View posts and categories
  - Comment on posts
  - Heart posts
  - Search posts
  - Filter posts by category
  - Sort by date, category, and amount of hearts

## Prerequisites
- PHP 8.3
- Composer

## Setup/Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/KreativeName1/blog-laravel.git"
```
2. Change the directory and run the setup script. It creates the .env file, installs the dependencies, generates the application key, migrates and seeds the database, and starts the server.
```bash
cd blog-laravel
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
## Note
This was my first Laravel project. I was following this [tutorial](https://laraveldaily.com/course/laravel-beginners).
